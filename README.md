# CountryCodes

## Problem description
Every now and then some of my peers and I come up with random programming
challenges. This time the task was to write the fastest country code finder.
That is, given a list of country codes and a phone number, determine which
country the phone number belongs to.

This is a type of string matching problem where we want to find the country code
that is equal to the first few digits of the phone number.

The list of country codes used can be found at http://country.io/phone.json.
